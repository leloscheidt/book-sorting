<!-- 
		1 - The key of the entry should be the name of the attribute to sort
		    and the value of the entry should be the direction of sorting.
		
		2 - The order of the entries within the file is the order precedence of sorting. 
			So writing
			 <entry key="author">descending</entry>
			 <entry key="title">ascending</entry>
			 
			Is different than writing 
			 <entry key="title">ascending</entry>
			 <entry key="author">descending</entry>
		
		3 - If, for one key none comparator is found, the condition is ignored.
		
		4 - The entries values should be 'ascending' and 'descending' only, 
		    other values will be interpreter as 'ascending' by the application.
